Concurrency Control Example

This example demonstrates the new native concurrency control features in the 
multiplexer-llm package, showing how to:

1. Set per-endpoint concurrency limits
2. Preserve weighted distribution while respecting capacity
3. Handle overflow gracefully when endpoints are busy
4. Configure the httpx client with high connection limits since
   concurrency is now managed at the application layer

Key Benefits:
- Move concurrency control from network layer to application layer
- Better separation of concerns
- More intelligent load balancing
- Prevents request queuing bottlenecks

🩹 SELF-HEALING & REBALANCING BEHAVIOR:
=========================================

This system implements INTELLIGENT SELF-HEALING REBALANCING:

• Model Selection: Selection happens randomly for EVERY single request using weighted roulette wheel
• Capacity Checks: Atomic try_reserve_slot() calls prevent race conditions
• Immediate Rebalancing: As soon as ONE slot opens (e.g., 25/25 → 24/25), 
  the next request can immediately route back to that model
• Zero Manual Intervention: No queue draining, no manual rebalancing steps needed
• Stateless Operation: Load balancing decisions are made per-request without
  maintaining complex state machines or waiting for conditions to be met

This creates a "self-healing" system where:
1. Models at capacity automatically get skipped during selection
2. Models with available slots immediately become eligible again
3. Load automatically redistributes as capacity changes
4. The system continuously adapts to real-time capacity constraints
